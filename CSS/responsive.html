            <h4>Meet Jerry</h4>
            <p>
                With eyes full of wisdom and a coat that glows like sunshine, Jerry is more than just a dog — he's the
                soul of the home. A proud Labrador Retriever, Jerry carries himself with gentle dignity and a quiet
                charm that instantly puts everyone at ease.

            <h4>Meet Tom</h4>
            <p>
                Tom isn’t just a pet. He’s a listener, a protector, and a best friend. He’s the one who greets you with
                joy after a long day, who sits beside you during quiet evenings, and who reminds you that love can be
                simple and unconditional.
